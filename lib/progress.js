// Rules for per-viewer playback progress (k(`progress:${email}`)), with no Redis.
//
// The player saves a position every few seconds, and before these rules the
// route accepted ANY string up to 100 characters as a video id, with no rate
// limit. A signed-in viewer could therefore grow their own progress hash
// without bound. Three bounds now apply, each cheap enough for a request that
// fires every eight seconds:
//
//   * the id must look like a bunny video id (isProgressVideoId);
//   * the route rate-limits saves (pages/api/progress.js);
//   * the hash holds at most MAX_PROGRESS_ENTRIES videos. A save for a NEW
//     video at the cap drops the least recently watched entries first
//     (progressToEvict), so resume keeps working for what someone is watching
//     now — refusing instead would quietly break it after enough years.

// Matches the whole-library read bound (lib/videoLibrary.js MAX_LIBRARY_VIDEOS):
// nobody can be part-way through more videos than the library holds.

// fits under `max`: the least recently updated first, and an entry with no
// readable time counts as the oldest of all. Entries may arrive as JSON text.
