// It runs on the admin video list, the same place the new-video push announce
// already rides, and from a scheduled job (pages/api/cron/transcripts.js). It
// is best-effort end to end: an admin loading their own video list must never
// see an error because a transcript could not be collected. Whatever fails is
// tried again next time, until the job ages out. One run at a time — see the
// lock in lib/captionsStore.js.
