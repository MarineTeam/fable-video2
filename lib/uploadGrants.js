// and the current group records, and only creates the bunny.net video if the
// answer is ok. Refusing afterwards would leave an orphan video in the library
// for a request that was never going to be honoured.
//
// Why uploads grant at all: with GROUP_CONTENT_GATING on, a group sees only
// what it is granted, so a new video was live for everyone except the people
// in the group it was meant for, until someone added it on the Groups tab. Ticking
// the groups on the upload card closes that at the one moment the admin is
// already thinking about who the video is for.
//
// There is deliberately NO stored "default group for new uploads". A default
// grants silently, on every upload, long after whoever set it has forgotten
// it exists — access that nobody chose on the day.
