// Client half of the Query Monitor. Deliberately separate from lib/monitor.js

// browser bundle. It owns the store of observed API calls, a pub/sub, and
// resetMonitorCalls(), so a page can signal "the view changed" without
// importing a React component just to reach a side-effecting helper.
//
// There is NO build-time client flag. Whether the monitor is on is decided
// server-side by QUERY_MONITOR_ENABLED and learned at runtime via
// /api/monitor, so one env var toggles the whole feature with no rebuild.
// The fetch wrapper below installs unconditionally as a trade-off: it's a
// pure pass-through that reads one response header and never throws, and it
// stops recording entirely the moment the server reports the monitor is off.
