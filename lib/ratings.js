// Per-viewer ratings: was this worth watching?
//
// PURE — imports nothing, for the same reason as lib/chapters.js and
// lib/mylist.js: the watch page renders the buttons in the browser, so
// anything pulled in here lands in the client bundle and a lib/redis import
// would drag Node built-ins in and fail the build. Redis lives in
// lib/ratingsStore.js, the same split as chapters.js / chaptersStore.js.
//
// TWO STRUCTURES, and the split is the privacy decision:
//
//   k(`ratings:${email}`)  videoGuid -> 'up' | 'down'   the truth, per viewer
//   k('rating_counts')     `${guid}:up` -> integer      totals, no identities
//
// The vote is stored under the VIEWER's key, not the video's, beside their
// progress and saved list, so a per-viewer cleanup has one place to look. A
// hash keyed by video would have scattered a person's address across a row
// per video. (No such cleanup runs yet — removing a viewer leaves all three;
// see FEATURES.md's known gaps.)
//
// The counters therefore hold no email at all. They are maintained by
// applying a delta on each vote rather than by counting rows — in the same
// Redis script as the vote itself (lib/ratingScripts.js), so the two cannot
// drift apart — which means
// one HGETALL gives an admin every video's totals, and a viewer's identity is
// never derivable from them.
//
// WHO SEES WHAT: a viewer sees their OWN rating and nothing else. Totals are
// staff-only. In a library watched by a few dozen people a visible '2 down' on
// a talk is a social problem the product does not need, and at that N a public
// counter is close to attributable anyway — three viewers and one downvote is
// a guess with good odds. The counts exist so an admin can see what landed,
// not so viewers can rank each other's teaching.
