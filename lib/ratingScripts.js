// The two Lua scripts that keep rating totals equal to the votes.
//
// Before these, a vote and its counter were two separate writes: the vote
// first, then a best-effort HINCRBY. A failure between them left the total one
// short for good, and two clicks racing each other both read "no previous
// vote" and both incremented. Redis runs a script as one command — nothing
// else touches either hash while it runs — so the read of the previous vote,
// the vote itself and both counter moves now happen together or not at all.
//
// Kept in a module of their own, with no imports, so the tests can run the
// exact strings against a real redis-server (lib/__tests__/ratingScripts.test.js)
// rather than against a mock that would agree with whatever it was told.
//
// The field layout is the one lib/ratings.js documents: the vote lives at
// k(`ratings:${email}`) -> guid -> 'up' | 'down', the totals at
// k('rating_counts') -> '<guid>:up' / '<guid>:down' -> integer.

// KEYS[1]  the viewer's ratings hash
// KEYS[2]  the counters hash
// ARGV[1]  video id
// ARGV[2]  'up', 'down', or '' to clear
//
// Returns 1 when something changed, 0 for a no-op. A stored value that is not
// exactly 'up' or 'down' reads as no vote, matching normalizeVote(): it is
// overwritten by a real vote without decrementing anything, and a clear leaves
// it alone — the same answers the old read-then-write path gave.

// KEYS[1]     the counters hash
// KEYS[2..n]  every viewer's ratings hash
//
// Rebuilds the counters from the votes and REPLACES them, so drift from before
// VOTE_SCRIPT existed is corrected rather than carried forward. Returns
// { votes counted, counter fields written }.
//
// Atomic for the same reason: a vote landing halfway through a recount would
// otherwise be counted by the script and then again by its own HINCRBY. A
// viewer whose hash did not exist when the key list was taken is the one gap —
// their first vote can land between the scan and this script and be dropped
// from the rebuilt total. It is a one-vote, self-evident window, and the next
// recount closes it.
//
// HSET is sent in slices because unpack() on a very large table can exceed
// Lua's C stack; 200 field/value pairs per call is far below that limit.
